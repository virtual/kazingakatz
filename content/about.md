Kazinga Katz kittens are raised in home and under foot with dogs and other cats. We love and respect all of our fur babies here! Health and happiness is number one.  We are currently breeding F3 and F6 generation Savannah cats. Shipping available for an additional fee. Contact us at kazingakatz@gmail.com for breeder pricing or any questions.
